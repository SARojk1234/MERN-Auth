**MERN Stack User Authentication Project**

Welcome to the MERN Stack User Authentication project! This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive example of user authentication using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of user authentication features such as user registration, login, and logout using the MERN stack. It includes the following components:

1. **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the database to store user information securely.
2. **Express.js**: Express.js is used to build the backend API endpoints for user authentication.
3. **React.js**: React.js is used for the frontend user interface, including forms for registration and login.
4. **Node.js**: Node.js is used to run the server-side code and handle API requests.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
- User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- Protected Routes: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication.
- Logout: Users can securely log out of their accounts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-authentication.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd mern-authentication
```

3. Install dependencies for both the server and client:

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ..
cd client
npm install
```

4. Set up the MongoDB connection:
   - Create a MongoDB database and obtain the connection URI.
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Replace `your_mongodb_uri` with your MongoDB connection URI and `your_jwt_secret` with a secret key for JWT.

5. Start the server and client:

```bash
# Start the server
cd ..
cd server
npm start

# Start the client
cd ..
cd client
npm start
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
